# tlib
This "library" was originally just a single Python file in my site-packages folder containing a handful of functions I often found myself reusing for similar projects.
Most of the applications I'd use these functions in were just random little scripts that never made their way to any machine other than mine, however I've found myself using some of these functions in many different applications deployed on multiple servers; so I've created this repository to simply save myself time when deploying said applications.
